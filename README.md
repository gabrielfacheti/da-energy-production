	<h1>Data Analysis Project: Monthly Electricity Statistics</h1>
<p>This project is a data analysis project developed using Python. The objective is to analyze and gain insights from the Monthly Electricity Statistics dataset. The dataset includes information about energy production in various countries on a monthly basis from 2010 to 2022. The data is available <a href="http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&amp;f=cmID%3aEL">here</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset covers a range of energy products, including hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear, fossil fuels, and others. Energy production is measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh). The primary focus of the project is to compare the energy production and consumption in Brazil with that of other countries.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>The project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pandas</li>
	<li>Matplotlib</li>
	<li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the project, you can download the dataset from the link provided above and save it to your local machine. Then, you can run the <code>energy_analysis.py</code> script to analyze the data.</p>

<p>The script includes functions to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame</li>
	<li>Clean and preprocess the data</li>
	<li>Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<p>The script produces various plots and visualizations that provide insights into the energy production and consumption trends in different countries.</p>
